## Paper Title: A Graph-based Java Projects Representation for Antipatterns Detection
This repository contains the implementation and supporting materials for the scientific paper titled "A Graph-based Java Projects Representation for Antipatterns Detection". The paper proposes a method to identify and resolve antipatterns in large-scale Java projects, aiming to improve software quality and maintainability.

### In the following, the relations type specification:
- exists: The exists relationship establishes class hierarchies and reveals interdependencies between classes. This relationship occurs when class c1 is a subclass of class c2. 
- uses_as_var: Understanding the uses_as_var relationship between methods and classes is essential for comprehending data flow in a software system. It enables the effective utilization of method outputs as variables, supporting class functionalities and complex computations. The uses_as_var relationship signifies the usage of a method's return value as a variable within a class. If method m1 defines a local variable of type c2, this relationship can be represented as an edge. 
- uses_as_arg: Analyzing the uses_as_arg relationship, along with other class-method relationships, enhances our understanding of how classes depend on method parameters to achieve desired functionalities. It reveals interactions and dependencies within a system, contributing to software architecture comprehension and design. The uses_as_arg relationship involves the utilization of method parameters within a class. It signifies the dependency between a method and a class, where the class relies on a specific parameter of the method to fulfill functionalities. By capturing and analyzing these dependencies, we gain a deeper understanding of the interactions and interdependencies between classes and methods in a system.
- returns: Understanding and analyzing the returns relationship aids in comprehending how methods generate specific object or class outputs. It reveals dependencies and interactions within a system, contributing to software architecture comprehension and design. The returns relationship denotes the return type of a method, which can be an object or a class. By capturing and analyzing these dependencies, we gain a deeper understanding of the relationships between methods and their return types.
